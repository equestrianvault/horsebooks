This project uses the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) method of contributing and must pass all unit tests and a review before it will be accepted.

Feel free to check out the list of issues [here](https://github.com/tsitra/horsebooks/issues) for items to work on.

For questions and discussion, check out the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4Bh49Y8).

You will want to test your changes locally, so having [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) installed will be a huge boon. After that's done, a simple `npm install` run from the root of the project should get the application setup, then `ng serve` to run it on [your local computer](https::localhost:4000).

Check out the official websites for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for more information.
