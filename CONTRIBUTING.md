This project used the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) method of contributing and must pass all unit tests before it will be accepted.

Feel free to check out the list of issues [here](https://github.com/tsitra/horsebooks/issues).

You will want to test it locally, so having [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed will be a huge boon. You will also need ANGULAR-clu installed, so run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install it. After that's done, a simple `npm install` run from the root of the project should get the application setup, then `ng serve` to run it on [your local computer](https::localhost:4000).

Check out the official websites for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for more information.
