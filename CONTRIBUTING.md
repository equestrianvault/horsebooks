# Contributing

## Introduction

This project uses the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) method of contributing and must pass all unit tests and a review before it will be accepted.

## Issues / How can I contribute?

Feel free to check out the list of issues [here](https://github.com/tsitra/horsebooks/issues) for items to work on. This is an open list, so feel free to contribute to it. All issues will go through a review process. Similarly, expect a review of issues and PRs when contributing before they are accepted.

## Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - obviously you'll need some client to download the source code
* [Github Account](https://github.com/) - only needed to contribute

## Running

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Please do not commit the dist/ directory. The hosting service automatically generates this for us when it builds the site to serve it.

## Testing

When you add a feature, please be sure to add the appropriate unit/end-to-end tests and that existing tests are updated or otherwise pass.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Financing / Donations

We presently don't have a way to accept donations; there is some legal air needed to be cleared with the project owner and his place of employment before we're comfortable moving forward with that. This is volunteer basis and a passion project for now. Similarly, some of the technology decisions are based around what is available for free, even if we have plans in the future on how to run with a strategic financial investment.
